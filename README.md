Space API
=========

This library was started to better understand how Flight Dynamics works. It
has no intent of efficiency nor performance at the moment, and the goal is
mainly for me to develop a simple API for space observations.

Installation
------------

Space API only requires Python 3.5 and numpy. To install it use pip

    pip install space-api
